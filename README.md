# LivingInChrist

Designed by me completely based on the experience I have gathered in the past few months.

It is a simple application for Christians to try to live in Christ.

There are 4 features of this app, a streak counter which can be used for your own personal uses such as fasting or resisting tempations. Another is a daily plan checklist where you can tick the daily activities for the steps in your day. There is also a Quiz game feature where you can test your biblical knowledge.

Last but not the least, a Bible Study section designed for you to keep track of your own progress either by theme or book. Currently it lacks the feature of pre loaded study materials, I may choose to add it in the future but right now it is mainly for your personal progress.
